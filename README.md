## What's this project about?
Recap of University of Python course, with the most important Python basics, exception treatment, classes design and a final capstone project
## What are the different parts of the capstone project?
The capstone project consists of.
- Two classes (garden and plants) and 1 superclass of plants for processed products.
- A basic exception management class for controlling exceptions when not enough water is available for watering.
- A couple of useful functions, such as watering the garden and adding uses to plants (skin care, decoration, etc.)
- A module for updating the garden files that contain all the info about our garden (plant details, water intake and available water). If no garden files exist, a .txt file is created.
## How to use this garden?
- In the folder **classes**, find **gardenTasks** to add plants to the garden, add new gardens, add processed products and water the garden.
- In the module  **managingGardenFiles**, retrieve the current garden info and write it to a txt file named gardenFiles.
